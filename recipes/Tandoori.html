    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Moist, luscious, and delicious. Just the right blend of spices make this chicken dish one of my most-requested. Great hot or cold. If using thighs with skin, you can put over direct medium heat for the last few minutes to crisp skin.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) containers plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>16 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>olive oil spray</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>    
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together yogurt, salt, pepper, cloves, and ginger. Mix in garlic, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Rinse chicken under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, press air out of bag, and seal. Turn the bag over several times to distribute marinade. Place bag in a bowl, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight, turning bag occasionally.        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for direct medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from bag, and discard marinade. With paper towels, wipe off excess marinade. Spray chicken pieces with olive oil spray.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on the grill, and cook about 2 minutes. Turn, and cook 2 minutes more. Then arrange the chicken to receive indirect heat, and cook approximately 35 to 40 minutes, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F.</li>
      </ol>
